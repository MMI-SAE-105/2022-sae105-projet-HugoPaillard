        <h3>"We all wanted to see adorable animals kicking ass" Mark Osborne, director.</h3>
        <h3>"We wanted to make the most beautiful kung fu movie of all time. I'm thrilled that in the end it became a comedy, a comedy with a touch of drama and poetry. We kept a very strong artistic direction while telling a comic story about a panda that is out of its element. Everyone who worked on it is very proud of it, and that experience still serves them well today." Raymond Zibach, head set designer</h3>
        <h3>"Raymond Zibach, our set designer, brought a very strong vision to the film.He is not afraid to do things differently. The sky can be orange and the art can be abstract, but it's also grounded in reality. We really valued our research and brought in a lot of experts throughout the shoot. Even though this world shows a feline in pajamas, we wanted to respect the culture of China's history, and that worked to our advantage in the end. It would have been easier to show a simpler, more cartoony China, but we wanted real emotions and real issues in addition to the comedy aspect." Melissa Cobb, producer</h3>
        <h3>"People really identified with Po, the hero of the film. He has this insecurity in him that doesn't leave him and I think it will stay with him in any film we make about him. The context is different (he lives in ancient China and he faces animals), but he has this typical human vulnerability. Even when he goes up in the air with a rocket and crashes to the ground like Vil Coyote, he still has deeply human emotions. Physically, it's crazy, but the emotions are real." Melissa Cobb, producer</h3>
